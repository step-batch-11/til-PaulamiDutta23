# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
 - sin wave and cos wave working model
 - PPM working model
 - There are ways to read and write inputs and outputs to stdin and stdout other than prompt() and console.log()
- What changed in your understanding?
 - The working principle of PPM.
 - The working principle of prompt().
- What would you explain differently now?
 - It's not only that we can pipe result in terminal/shell but also in programming(JS).

---

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully?
 - Working process of pipeTo and pipeThrough 
- What would you like to see one more example of?
 - Deno.stdin.readable, Deno.stdout.writeable, pipeTo and pipeThrough
- What feels fragile in your understanding?
 - pipeThrough

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- How does the pipeTo and pipeThrough work?
- How does Deno.stdout.writeable work?
- How does prompt() work?
- How is prompt() different from Deno.stdin.readable?
- What is pseudo terminal?
- What is controller? What does it do? And how does it work?

# What I Have Done Today

- random path maker
- implemented sin and cos wave

---

# Things To Do

- Explore the topics taught today from documentation and more.
- Implement those.
- code for displaying png image on terminal.
- improve pokedex.
- improve orchestration engine.
- shell script.
- continue reading NOC.

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- pipeTo
- pipeThrough
- generating infinity sign (more about trigonometric function and curves)

---

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because I understood the sin and cos function curves and explored about PNG file format.
