# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- The lines of code after await statement get wrapped up in a then block and pushed in the micro task queue.
- While reading from a file it doesn't empty the buffer array(Uint8Array) and push the new bytes, rather it overwrites the buffer array each time.
- For Deno.SeekMode.End, should give negative offset to get the data / file content.
- If we don't mention any option while opening a file using Deno.open, by default it opens in read mode.

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- pipeTo, pipeThrough working model.
- what happens when we open a tty as file in read mode?
- Parser using class (scanner class approach)

# Questions to Chase

---

# What I Have Done Today

- I explored FsFile.seek, FsFile.read, FsFile.write, FsFile.readable.
- I read about async await, for await of.

---

# Things To Do

- Improve parser for head assignment
- Implement head assignment using another approach.
- Read about readable stream, writable stream, transform stream.
- Explore more about the topics covered in session.

# One-Sentence Summary

Finish this sentence:

> Today was useful because **the idea of async await and for await of became clearer, I learnt more about file system**.
